After you remove a failed drive from the failed drive list in the Element user interface (UI), you are ready to physically replace the failed drive from the chassis.

* You have removed the failed drive from the cluster by using the Element UI.
* You have obtained the slot number of the failed drive from the Element UI.
* You have reviewed xref:concept_sf_series_drive_best_practices.adoc[Rules for handling drives].

. Unpack the replacement drive, and place it on a flat, static-free surface near the rack.
+
Save the packing materials for when you return the failed drive to NetApp.

. Match the slot number of the failed drive from the Element UI with the number on the chassis.
+
The following figure is an example to show the numbering of the drive slots:
