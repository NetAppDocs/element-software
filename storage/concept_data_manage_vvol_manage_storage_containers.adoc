A storage container is a vSphere datastore representation created on a cluster running Element software.

Storage containers are created and tied to NetAppElement accounts. A storage container created on Element storage appears as a vSphere datastore in vCenter and ESXi. Storage containers do not allocate any space on Element storage. They are simply used to logically associate virtual volumes.

A maximum of four storage containers per cluster is supported. A minimum of one storage container is required to enable VVols functionality.
