You can delete an account when it is no longer needed.

Delete and purge any volumes associated with the account before you delete the account.

IMPORTANT: Persistent volumes that are associated with management services are assigned to a new account that is created during installation or upgrade. If you are using persistent volumes, do not modify or delete their associated account.

. Select *Management* > *Accounts*.
. Click the Actions icon for the account you want to delete.
. In the resulting menu, select *Delete*.
. Confirm the action.
