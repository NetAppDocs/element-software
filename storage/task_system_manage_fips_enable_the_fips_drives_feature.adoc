You can enable the FIPS drives feature by using the NetApp Element software EnableFeature API method.

Encryption at Rest must be enabled on the cluster and all nodes and drives must be FIPS capable, as indicated when the GetFipsReport displays a Ready status for all nodes.

. Using the Element API, enable FIPS on all drives by entering:
+
`EnableFeature params: FipsDrives`
