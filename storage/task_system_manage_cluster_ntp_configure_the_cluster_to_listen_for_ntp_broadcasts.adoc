By using the broadcast mode, you can instruct each node in a cluster to listen on the network for Network Time Protocol (NTP) broadcast messages from a particular server.

* You must have cluster administrator privileges to configure this setting.
* You must configure an NTP server on your network as a broadcast server.

. Click *Cluster* > *Settings*.
. Enter the NTP server or servers that are using broadcast mode into the server list.
. Under Network Time Protocol Settings, select *Yes* to use a broadcast client.
. To set the broadcast client, in the *Server* field, enter the NTP server you configured in broadcast mode.
. Click *Save Changes*.
