A Quality of Service (QoS) policy enables you to create and save a standardized quality of service setting that can be applied to many volumes. You can create, edit, and delete QoS policies from the QoS Policies page on the Management tab.

NOTE: If you are using QoS policies, do not use custom QoS on a volume. Custom QoS will override and adjust QoS policy values for volume QoS settings.
