You might need to allow the following TCP ports through your datacenter's edge firewall so that you can manage the system remotely and allow clients outside of your datacenter to connect to resources. Some of these ports might not be required, depending on how you use the system.

All ports are TCP unless stated otherwise, and should permit bi-directional communications between the NetApp Support Server, management node, and nodes running Element software.

TIP: Enable ICMP between the management node, nodes running Element software, and cluster MVIP.

The following abbreviations are used in the table:

* MIP: Management IP address, a per-node address
* SIP: Storage IP address, a per-node address
* MVIP: Management virtual IP address
* SVIP: Storage virtual IP address
