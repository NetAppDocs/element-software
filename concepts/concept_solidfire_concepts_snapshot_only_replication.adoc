Snapshot-only data protection replicates changed data at specific points of time to a remote cluster. Only those snapshots that are created on the source cluster are replicated. Active writes from the source volume are not.

You can set the frequency of the snapshot replications.

Snapshot replication does not affect asynchronous or synchronous replication.
