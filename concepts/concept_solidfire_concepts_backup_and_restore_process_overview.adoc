You can back up and restore volumes to other SolidFire storage, as well as to secondary object stores that are compatible with Amazon S3 or OpenStack Swift.

You can back up a volume to the following:

* A SolidFire storage cluster
* An Amazon S3 object store
* An OpenStack Swift object store

When you restore volumes from OpenStack Swift or Amazon S3, you need manifest information from the original backup process. If you are restoring a volume that was backed up on a SolidFire storage system, no manifest information is required.
