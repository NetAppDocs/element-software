A clone of a single volume or multiple volumes is point-in-time copy of the data. When you clone a volume, the system creates a snapshot of the volume and then creates a copy of the data referenced by the snapshot.

This is an asynchronous process, and the amount of time the process requires depends on the size of the volume you are cloning and the current cluster load.

The cluster supports up to two running clone requests per volume at a time and up to eight active volume clone operations at a time. Requests beyond these limits are queued for later processing.
