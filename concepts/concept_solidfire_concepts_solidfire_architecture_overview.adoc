A SolidFire all-flash storage system is comprised of discrete hardware components (drive and nodes) that are combined into a pool of storage resources with NetApp Element software running independently on each node. This single storage system is managed as a single entity by using the Element software UI, API and other management tools.

A SolidFire storage system includes the following hardware components:

* Cluster, the hub of the SolidFire storage system, includes a collection of nodes.
* Nodes are the hardware components grouped into a cluster. There are two types of nodes:
 ** Storage nodes, which are servers containing a collection of drives
 ** Fibre Channel (FC) nodes, which you use to connect to FC clients
* Drives are used in storage nodes and store data for the cluster. A storage node contains two types of drives:
 ** Volume metadata drives store information that defines the volumes and other objects within a cluster.
 ** Block drives store data blocks for volumes.

You manage the system by using Element software or a VMware vSphere Web Client.

* Element software runs on the hardware and you can use it to create a cluster and manage storage services.
* The NetApp Element Plug-in for vCenter Server (also referred to as the vCenter Plug-in, or VCP) is a web-based tool integrated with the VMware vSphere Web Client user interface (UI). The plug-in is an alternative scalable, user-friendly interface for VMware vSphere that can manage and monitor storage resources, including datastores, volumes, quality of service, storage cluster components, and data protection.

By default, Element sends performance and alert statistics to the NetApp SolidFire Active IQ Collector. NetApp Support monitors this data and alerts you to any performance issues.
