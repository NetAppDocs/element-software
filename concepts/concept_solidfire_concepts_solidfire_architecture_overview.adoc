A SolidFire all-flash storage system is comprised of discrete hardware components (drive and nodes) that are combined into a pool of storage resources with NetApp Element software running independently on each node. This single storage system is managed as a single entity by using the Element software UI, API and other management tools.

A SolidFire storage system includes the following hardware components:

* *Cluster*: The hub of the SolidFire storage system that is a collection of nodes.
* *Nodes*: The hardware components grouped into a cluster. There are two types of nodes:
 ** Storage nodes, which are servers containing a collection of drives
 ** Fibre Channel (FC) nodes, which you use to connect to FC clients
* *Drives*: Used in storage nodes to store data for the cluster. A storage node contains two types of drives:
 ** Volume metadata drives store information that defines the volumes and other objects within a cluster.
 ** Block drives store data blocks for volumes.
