Element software cluster API methods enable you to manage the configuration and topology of the storage cluster and the nodes that belong to a storage cluster.

Some cluster API methods operate on nodes that are part of a cluster, or have been configured to join a cluster. You can add nodes to a new cluster or to an existing cluster. Nodes that are ready to be added to a cluster are in a "pending" state, which means they have been configured but not yet added to the cluster.
