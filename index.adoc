= SolidFire and Element Software 12.3 Documentation

A SolidFire all-flash storage system is comprised of hardware components such as drives and nodes that are combined into a pool of storage resources. As a single storage system, this unified cluster is managed with NetApp Element software.

Using the Element interface, API, or other management tools, you can:

* Monitor cluster storage capacity and performance.
* Manage storage activity across a multi-tenant infrastructure.

== Deployment options
SolidFire offers different deployment options:

* link:concepts/concept_solidfire_concepts_solidfire_architecture_overview.html[SolidFire all-flash storage overview]: Use storage nodes provided by NetApp and integrated with NetApp Element software.

* link:esds/concept_get_started_esds.html[NetApp SolidFire Enterprise SDS]: Use your own server to run Element software by using containerized SolidFire eSDS.
